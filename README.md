NB: There have been a number of updates since this file was first created. The lastest API for the data is can be found on the FEMA <a href= "https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/fima-nfip-redacted-claims-v2"> website</a>.

The csv would be extracted with: 
``` python
z = pd.read_csv("https://www.fema.gov/about/reports-and-data/openfema/FimaNfipClaims.csv")
```
